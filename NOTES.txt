BIG TOPICS:
1.	Rendering Engine
2.	Physics Engine

Other topics:
1.	Some way to insert game into engine
2.	Better scratchpad support
3.	Better textures (reading, blitting, basic image processing)
4.	Some way to separate game and engine data
5.	Add higher level rendering constructrs (Shaders, Materials, Meshes, Transforms)
6.	Add some form of automatic shader selection
7.	Add some form of primitives (Rectangles, Spheres)
8.	More flexible transform class (default values for projection and camera)
9.	Non-perspective views (orthogonal views)
10.	Texture manipulation (translation, rotation, scale)
11.	More control over textures (filtering, formatting)
12.	More friendly constructors
13.	Window should have more properties (center position, fullscreen, maybe mouse locking)
14.	Better vector math (normalization, +=, commonly used Vector constants, swizzling support)
15.	Options class / system, some place to read values that the player chooses
16.	Centralized "level" or "scene" class that holds the data the game is using
17.	Game object class
18.	Make all positioning names "position"
19.	Make naming more consistent
20.	Vector swizzling
21.	Make all time based on seconds rather than nanoseconds
22.	Change the way delta time is passed
22.	Give vectors a copy constructor
23.	Give vectors an interpolation method
24.	Transparency support
25.	Sprite support
26.	Good way to compare vectors
27.	Vector2D cross product
28.	Some way to display text
29.	Eventually, make easier way to generate a mesh
30.	Eventually, make easier way of generating texture coordinates
