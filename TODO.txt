1.	Test time needed for the Matrix4D::ToString() method
2.	Create a nice design for loading 3D models
3.	Config map of values should be refreshed once in a while, so that configuration values can be reconfigured during runtime.
4.	Don't use hard-coded values. Ever!
5.	Improve logging functionality. Maybe Log class should be a parent for all different kinds of logging classes. In a possible scenario some class X would register to one of this logging classes (with some logging level) and this way whenever some X member function is called (and/or finished) log would appear automatically. This way we could achieve a better isolation of concerns from the actuall algorithm and logging.
6.	Memory deallocation
7.	Create a macro for pointer safe deleting (something like #define SAFE_DELETE(p) if(p) { delete p; p = NULL; }
8.	Filename class member variable in several resource-related classes should be moved to their base class (which for now is called ReferenceCounter, but should be renamed to e.g. Resource)
9.	Create a possibility to display a light direction (current solution does not work correctly)s
