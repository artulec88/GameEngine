1.	Test time needed for the Matrix4D::ToString() method
2.	Create a nice design for loading 3D models
3.	Config map of values should be refreshed once in a while, so that configuration values can be reconfigured during runtime (?).
4.	Don't use hard-coded values. Ever!
5.	Improve logging functionality. Maybe Log class should be a parent for all different kinds of logging classes. In a possible scenario some class X would register to one of this logging classes (with some logging level) and this way whenever some X member function is called (and/or finished) log would appear automatically. This way we could achieve a better isolation of concerns from the actual algorithm and logging.
6.	Memory allocation / deallocation.
7.	Filename class member variable in several resource-related classes should be moved to their base class (which for now is called ReferenceCounter, but should be renamed to e.g. Resource)
8.	Create a possibility to display a light direction (current solution does not work correctly)
9.	Create a script probing the application and creating a report on how much CPU and memory it uses.
10.	Read about "Light space perspective shadow maps" and "Shadow volumes" (for enabling shadows in point lights)
11.	Skybox is not seamless
12.	Create a decorator class (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern#C.2B.2B) for the GameManager::Load method. The decorator sets/checks the state of the GameManager::m_isGameLoaded member variable, calls the GameManager::Load method and sets/checks the state of the GameManager::m_isGameLoaded member variable again.
13.	The night texture should be displayed much later than right now.
14.	Use alpha maps for the terrain (and generally for all objects with multitexturing). The alpha map is just another texture with 4 channels (RGBA). Each channel represents how much of the specific texture should be applied on an object. Basically the result should be something like (texture1 * alphaMap.r + texture2 * alphaMap.g + ... ). This way an object may be textured with up to 4 different textures.
15.	Optimize the AlmostEqual function. Basically, find the fastest way to compare two floating-point numbers.
16.	Add Renderer::m_skyboxAngleStep to the tweak bars.
17.	Closing the game with the "X" button in the right top corner of the window during the loading phase of the game causes an exception (only probably, needs to be checked!)
18.	Ambient occlussion.
19.	Water rendering. When looking in horizontal direction the distortion of the water texture is huge. Generally, it increases with the camera getting closer to the "horizontal" direction. The distortion should not depend on the viewing angle of the camera.
20.	When water is ON (there is at least one water node added) the billboards are not rendered correctly. When being seen from the close distance it is fine, but the farther they are the more dark they become. One thing (water rendering) should not influence the billboards at all.
21.	The book "3D game engine design: a practical approach to real-time computer graphics" asks the following questions:
		"How do I select points on a curve that are equally spaced along the curve?"
		"How do I move a camera with constant speed along a curved path?"
	The answer to these questions is to use reparameterization by arc length. Read more in the "Curves" chapter.
22.	"Batch-rendering": the IRenderable components do not draw. Instead, they just add the rendering command to the rendering engine. The rendering engine stores the collection of rendering commands. The core engine calls the rendering engine (at one specific correct time) to render all rendering commands. The rendering engine should store three maps:
		map<Shader, vector<Mesh>> shader2meshes
		map<Mesh, vector<Material>> mesh2materials
		map<Material, vector<Transform>> material2transforms.
	These maps should be updated when new rendering command is specified. When "final" render call is done the maps are iterated one by one to minimize the number of unnecessary OpenGL calls (e.g. binding the same shader, texture several times). Afterwards, the maps should be cleared to be empty for the next frame processing (and new rendering commands will appear).
	The "final" rendering call should be something like:
	for (Shader shader : shader2meshes.keys)
	{
		shader.Bind();
		shader.UpdateRenderUniforms();
		for (Mesh mesh : shader2meshes.values)
		{
			
		}
	}
23. Weather effects.
24. All game menu related settings should be in the separate config file (maybe an XML?). Maybe there should be several config files: one for the rendering module, one for Physics, one for Audio and so on.
25. Get rid of all calls to Engine::CoreEngine::GetCoreEngine()...
26. Implement ParticleSystemBuilder in the Game module.
27. Instead of having TerrainMesh doing rendering and storing the height values (double responsibility) it should only be responsible for rendering. The height values should somehow be stored in the MeshHeightComponent game component.
