1.	Test time needed for the Matrix4D::ToString() method
2.	Create a nice design for loading 3D models
3.	Config map of values should be refreshed once in a while, so that configuration values can be reconfigured during runtime.
4.	Don't use hard-coded values. Ever!
5.	Improve logging functionality. Maybe Log class should be a parent for all different kinds of logging classes. In a possible scenario some class X would register to one of this logging classes (with some logging level) and this way whenever some X member function is called (and/or finished) log would appear automatically. This way we could achieve a better isolation of concerns from the actual algorithm and logging.
6.	Memory deallocation
7.	Filename class member variable in several resource-related classes should be moved to their base class (which for now is called ReferenceCounter, but should be renamed to e.g. Resource)
8.	Create a possibility to display a light direction (current solution does not work correctly)
9.	Create a script probing the application and creating a report on how much CPU and memory it uses.
10.	Expand the CameraBar using AntTweakBar library with rotation of the selected camera.
11.	Read about "Light space perspective shadow maps" and "Shadow volumes" (for enabling shadows in point lights)
12.	HUD/GUI
13.	Text alignment
14.	Game state design pattern. Implement different states for the Renderer class. Depending on the game state Renderer::Render function should behave differently (e.g. render scene, render game menu)
15.	Skybox is not seamless
16.	Skybox day/night cycles. Smooth transition between one cubemap (representing daytime) and the other (representing nightime). Read http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11118186/procedural-dynamic-colouring-of-a-skybox-in-opengl
17.	Text shader should automatically detects window size. Even better would be to calculate vertex coordinates in world space on CPU and not in the shader.
18.	Loading the game only after starting the game (after clicking START in the main menu game state)
19.	Create a decorator class (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern#C.2B.2B) for the GameManager::Load method. The decorator sets/checks the state of the GameManager::m_isGameLoaded member variable, calls the GameManager::Load method and sets/checks the state of the GameManager::m_isGameLoaded member variable again.
